# raudio
A simple and easy-to-use audio library based on mini_al

raudio forks from raylib.audio module to become an standalone library. Actually, it was already possible to use this module as standalone for audio device management and sounds/music playing.

raudio API tries to be very simple and intuitive and it represents a thin layer over the powerful [mini_al library](https://github.com/dr-soft/mini_al), including support for multiple audio formats: WAV, OGG, MP3, FLAC, MOD, XM.
